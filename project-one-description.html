                        The dole request got negative reviews because users were frustrated with the digital services on the website visited by almost million visitors daily.

I was taking care of usability aspects during the iterative process while designing and testing the various results with users.

                        By translating user flows into low and high fidelity wireframes and applying design task at hand I could see the context of how people apply for the dole. The prototypes showed how to accomplish the main tasks in an easy to understand way.
                        Users were able to go from A to B in order of importance, using a format that is visually intuitive to follow without being distracted by other action options.

                        The prototype’s of focus was on how the process should direct the user and lead them through the layers to complete the action.
                        By separating primary from secondary actions, the prototype provides a clear starting point on the homepage and users are not overwhelmed with extraneous content.
