                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        The pension purchase process was generally experienced as difficult. When users were presented with options, they ware often insecure about what is best for them, resulting in not getting the information they are looking for. Based on the UX Research findings and going through the entire flow, I found opportunities for improvement in order to better match the flow to the needs of its users.

                        I collaborated remotely using FigJam whiteboard during Design thinking brainstorm sessions with designers, software engineers, BIA and product owner as a sole designer. My role was advisory and I talked about how I approached design decisions during the weekly design guild meetings and design system leads. Sometimes, I was resolving UI and visual design disagreements together within a well-established design system while communicating with stakeholders in a way that it appealed to their needs and expectations.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        By quickly wireframing, testing and iterating, I found that by educating and preparing users what they are actually about to do during the pension purchase process, works best for the product. During the feedback sessions I generated user flows, learned from taking criticism. I refined my flows and kept on going. I applied concepts around design theory in terms of typography, colours and grid. By adding interactive guidelines and explanatory text about what the product actually means. The micro-interactions and motion could then help understand the process they’re currently in, give direct feedback and prevent users from filling in incorrect information.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Interviews showed most users want to know how much money (per month) they’ll get when dealing with their pension, and the button “Bereken uw pension” was a challenging trigger to click on. I created site maps for information architecture and found out that the Offer page, missed chance of giving a clear information about the pension amount per month. It caused disappointment for some users, thereby missing focus and complete the flow.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        While evaluating the Information Architecture of the pension purchase on what the purpose of the process is, the label ‘Pensioen kopen’ caused confusion for some users. The card on the previous page mentioned ‘Bereken uw pensioen’, 
                        which is different then buying a pension. 
                        The crumble path listed ‘Bereken zelf uw maandelijkse pensioen’, while the label stated ‘Pensioen kopen’. These were two different actions. 
                        Users think of their pension as something they have saved, as an amount they already own, which will now be paid out. We have used the term ‘Purchasing’, that came across as something that they still needed to attain.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Interactive homepage came across as a clear and clean overview, thanks to animated navigation items. Users got a quick overview of what steps they can expect in the upcoming purchase process. Self- explanatory tooltips about what users see and what they do with it, added sufficient value to them. Clean and scannable offer page was now well understood, and it gave users a complete overview of their financial situation and the information they filled in during the flow.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Thanks to this project I learned the importance of communication. I only could ensure consistent user experience within the pension products ecosystem and stay aligned with brand design system thanks to repetitive Design system meetings and working closely with UX Designers from other departments.
                        For example, while working on our design system closed environment, it was important to respond faster to business questions. Having insight in all available components and code snippets, resulted in our products being quickly and easily deployable. Also, having variant components helped quickly prototyping complex interactions.
